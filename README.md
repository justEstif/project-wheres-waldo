# Project: Where's Waldo (A Photo Tagging App)

- A project made using the Firebase back-end.
- The assignment could be found in the [JavaScript and the Back-end](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app) section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Live
- I will create a live for the next version.
### Internal
- Uses React, React Router DOM and Styled-Componets
## Possible Future Additions
- I want to add more images and/or more missing pieces in the current image.
- Add a timer in the header, and better header styling
- Improve the query function
## Known Bugs
- There aren't serious bugs, but the way I have stored the location of images could be improve by thinking in terms of radius instead of exact borders. It will eliminate the need of multiple values in db.
- I think since the size of the image is large, it could take more time to load.
## Reflections
- I found this project to be challenging, but I was able to get a much better understanding of hooks, and a good introduction to React Hooks and Firebase DB. I still think I have much to learn in the Firebase side, and I do plan to style this better at some point. 
- I think this versions display is lacking, in that I forced the size of the image. I will have to make more responsive.
